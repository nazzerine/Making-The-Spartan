Basic Algorithms - Spring 2018

Prompt:

The SPARTAN-II program has been restarted and needs to get more soldiers out as the war is starting to look bad for the humans. Dr.Catherine Halsey has decided that instead of the normal procedure of choosing the survivors of the tests of the SPARTAN-II program it would be better to administer a more continuous evaluation of the candidates and disqualify the ones which fail to meet the mark.

In the new system each soldier gets an evaluation when he is selected to enroll. Throughout the course of the program they need to keep improving their score, which will be recorded at the next evaluation. Every soldier who does not meet the standard will be discarded at that evaluation. Only those who remain will get to be called SPARTAN-II commandos.

Help Dr.Catherine decide the eligible candidates who remain at the end.
